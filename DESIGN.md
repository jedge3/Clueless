This file is to list things that need to be implemented/changed.

Characters do not start in the hallways. They start in additional rooms next to their starting hallways. They are then forced to move into their starting hallways on their first turn. I believe these rooms are no longer able to be accessed?? but not sure on this.

It might be useful to change the cards from strings into classes.
